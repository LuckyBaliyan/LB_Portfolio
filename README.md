## 🧠 About This Portfolio

The **LB Portfolio** is a creative web experience built to represent the modern developer’s identity through motion, smooth flow, and clean design.

It combines:
- ⚛️ **React** — for a dynamic component-based structure  
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** — for scalable, minimal, and responsive styling  
- 🎞️ **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** — for cinematic motion and page transitions  
- 🌀 **Lenis** — for buttery-smooth, inertia-based scroll behavior  

Every animation, hover, and reveal has been crafted to feel deliberate and fluid — turning this portfolio into a **living showcase of creativity and code**.

## 💡 Design Philosophy

> **“Where design meets motion.”**  
> **“A portfolio built to move.”**  
> **“Crafted with React. Animated with GSAP. Styled in motion.”**

This portfolio was designed to **feel alive** — every scroll, transition, and animation adds to the storytelling.  
It’s not just a collection of pages; it’s a **continuous experience** powered by clean code and expressive motion.
